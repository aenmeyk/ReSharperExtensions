ReSharperExtensions
===================
This solution contains Live Templates and macros for [JetBrains ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/). The tm template allows you to write test method names as sentences with spaces, and the macro will replace the spaces with underscores as you type.

See [http://www.joaroyen.com/2010/08/resharpers-live-templates-can-do.html](http://www.joaroyen.com/2010/08/resharpers-live-templates-can-do.html) for more information.

The master branch is updated to with support for ReSharper 6, while support for ReSharper 5 is maintained in a separate branch.

## Tip ##
You can mount the template files in the Template Explorer to simplify the process of modifying the various live templates.
